As of October 17th, I have completed almost all of the frontend, which includes login/signup pages, an event timeline, an event form page, a request center for viewing sent and received requests, a profile page, an account settings page, and a profile settings page. It also includes an administrative user interface, where admin uses can view pending posts and accept or deny them. All of these pages are mostly functional apart from a few exceptions. For example, a user cannot currently change their password, and there is not yet a way to upload a profile photo or a photo to go with an event post. 
	
	What I plan to do next is create a new form for when a user selects the “Other” option (as opposed to a preapproved event on the list of events they have to choose from) when creating a post that will allow the user to enter the date and name of the event, and that will not show up when a preapproved event is selected (because it will have a preset name and date). After that, I will create a form that admin users can access to create events for the event list, so that an event can be added to the list without having to have a user submit a request. Following that, I will work on making it possible for users to upload photos and implementing push notifications.  
	
	Once the event form/posting process is modified, the ability to upload photos is added, and push notifications are implemented, the requirements of the MVP will be met.
